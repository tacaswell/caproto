# Channel Access Repeater
#
# The CA Repeater is basically a UDP proxy server. Its only role is to forward
# server beacons (a.k.a RsrvIsUp commands) to all clients on a host. It exists
# to cope with older system that do not broadcast correctly, failing to fan out
# the message to all clients reliably.

# Operation:
# 1. Try to bind to 0.0.0.0 on the CA REPEATER PORT. This may be set by the
#    environment variable EPICS_CA_REPEATER_PORT. The default is 5065.
# 2. If binding fails, assume a CA Repeater is already running. Exit.
# 3. When a UDP datagram is received from an unknown port:
#    - Check that the source host is localhost. If it is not, ignore it.
#    - The datagram data may be a RegisterRepeaterRequest (recent versions of
#      Channel Access) or blank (old versions of Channel Access).
#    - Stash the source port number.
#    - Send a RepeaterConfirmResponse to that source port.
#    - Send an empty datagram to any other ports we have stashed.
#    - Forward all subsequent messages to all ports we know about.
